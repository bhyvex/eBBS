** Makefile and osdeps.h entries for MACHTEN and HPUX

** NEW FEATURES:
** Added ability to mail send & reply operations to send mail outside the
   bbs by prefixing the recipient userid. The external mailer to be invoked
   is looked up in the etc/mailers file based on the prefix. 
** Added bbsmaild utility to distribution. This may be used from the command
   line (as bbsmail) or called by sendmail(8) to route mail into the bbs
   mail system.

   table slots to be reserved for sysops.

   allow the user to switch back and forth on the fly.

   Novice menu style but also works in Expert style.

   mail, not new mail. Enhanced board Sequential Read to have a "read all

** Fixed a bug in PostDisplay that allowed posting on post-restricted boards.

   the final 3.1 release.

16-MAR-1997

** NEW PORTS:
** Makefile and osdeps.h entries for IRIX added

** NEW FIXES:
** Security fix to disallow potentially dangerous e-mail addresses
   from being passed to sendmail. Thanks to Martin Straka
   (straka@a1fel.feld.cvut.cz) for reporting this.
** Some preprocessor directives rewritten to make them digestible
   by more compilers. Thanks to Cameron Bowes for the tip.
** Makefile and osdeps.h entries for FREEBSD fixed. Thanks to
   Pedro Giffuni and Anthony Kehoe for assistance.

   running external programs without a mode number in menu.desc.

   properly set up. Thanks to Randy Austin for the fix.

   in long group mail lists.

----------------

Version 3.1.1
17-AUG-1997

** NEW FEATURES:
** New PostMove command. See ReleaseNotes for what you have to fix in
   your access and menu.desc files to make this work.
** Menus now key on the first capital letter in the command name, if
   present, instead of the first letter. This allows two commands to
   begin with the same letter but bind to different keys, for example
   "Snork" and "snorQue". Thanks Rodolfo Gonzales for the reminder.
** Chat /kick command now accepts a message for display to the chat room,
   coded by SirSyko.
** Support added for cases where the remote host can be read from an
   environment variable instead of utmp/utmpx. (I may post my patches
   for linux login and sshd to make this work, sometime.)
** Couple of benign mods for the still-under-development client/server
   version of EBBS.
** Additional notes for MachTen in Makefile, from Bill Schwartz.

** NEW FIXES: 
** Fixed a couple of hostname-related buffer overflows in chatserv.c.
** Chat ignore lists no longer saved between sessions for users listed
   as 'restricted' in chatconfig.
** Hopefully corrected the problem in the 3.1 binary distribution which
   caused addition of new accounts to fail. I could not find an error in
   the packaging, so have to assume it was something I did in the build.
** config/info file updated to show Version 3.1.1, something I forgot
   to do in the 3.1 release.

Welcome to Eagles BBS 3.1.1

Eagles BBS 3 is a standalone, screen-oriented bulletin board package. 
It is the successor to Eagles BBS version 2, which was built upon Ed Luke's
Pirates BBS package. The user interface from those programs has been kept
intact for the most part, and some code has been reused. For the most part
this is a complete rewrite though, to correct some basic limitations and
inefficiencies present in Pirates and Eagles 2.x. 

This software has a fairly full-featured message posting and private mail
system, its own IRC-like chat system, and private talk facility. It has
configurable menus allowing custom arrangement of the builtin functions 
and any external programs you care to hook in.

One thing Eagles BBS is not suited for quite yet is as a fancy shell. 
All BBS users run as a single user, so things like shell access and
news do not integrate very well. You should probably look elsewhere if
BBS users are to be anything more than guests on your system.

One improvement over Pirates and old Eagles is much greater runtime
configuration. A lot of stuff you used to have to recompile to change is
now in config files read in at runtime. All of these files are ASCII so
they may be patched with an editor if needed. The stock config files are
in the config directory and reside in ~bbs/etc at runtime.

IMPORTANT:
If you are already using an earlier version of EBBS 3, be SURE to read the
ReleaseNotes and ChangeLog to see what has changed before continuing!!!

All documentation has been moved into the EBBS-Guide. Please consult it
for installation and configuration instructions, examples, and technical
information. 

The Linux ELF binary distribution, ebbs-3.1.1.bin.tar.gz, was built 
with gcc 2.7.2, libc 5.4.33, and binutils 2.8.1.0.1. You should have 
Linux 2.0 or later and the GNU shared C library version 5.4.x or later.
Earlier versions of the kernel and shared C library may or may not work.

The source distribution, ebbs-3.1.1.tar.gz, should build under recent 
versions of Linux, SunOS, Solaris, AIX, Digital Unix, NextStep, A/UX, 
Unixware, Ultrix, MachTen, HPUX, FreeBSD, and IRIX. You should go 
through the Makefile and osdeps.h to set up the conditional defines 
for your operating system -- see EBBS-Guide under "Building the Source" 
for details. 

If you have an operational EBBS 2.x that you want to convert to version 3,
you'll need the source distribution and the conversion package, cvtpkg.tar.gz.
It should be available at ftp://ftp.datasync.com/pub/ebbs or other sites. 
Get it and see the enclosed README for the scoop on getting your existing 
BBS converted to version 3.1.
   
Add-on packages (useful scripts, safe editors, etc.) are under development.
Check the ftp site mentioned above to see what's there.


EBBS Mailing List
-----------------

I have set up a mailing list for EBBS. There is no one on it but myself
as I write this, but I wanted it there before distributing this code,
so everyone who uses EBBS may be informed of security issues, bugs,
patches, and so forth as they happen. The list is not moderated at this
time so feel free to post for help with things. If it starts getting
a lot of traffic I'll make a separate moderated ebbs-announce list
for the important stuff.

To subscribe: send a message to majordomo@datasync.com with 

subscribe ebbs
end

in the body (not Subject) of the message. If that doesn't work
mail me at the address at the bottom of this file.


The TODO list
-------------

These features aren't there, but might be one day:

-- Mail clean program (will be released as an add-on package)
-- Tagging of messages in mail, for deleting or forwarding.
-- Reading lists that allow each user to specify the order to scan the
   boards during a new message scan.
-- The big TODO: A split into client and server, with which the client 
   can run on a different machine and do things like editing, menu movements,
   shell escapes, job control, etc. locally.
   (Update: I have a client/server pair that has all the regular features
    except talk working. It's really slow though. As soon as I can
    write some functional documentation for it, I'll throw it out
    for anyone who wants to experiment with it.)


Known Bugs
----------

-- On the File Menu, the "Current Board" is shown is not the currently
   selected File board. It is correct on the Download read-menu.
   (The fix isn't worth the trouble)
-- The file-based user table is reported to have some problems. This is
   only an issue if you do not have a shared memory facility.

This is Eagles BBS 3.1.1. This release was done mainly to merge
in a few neat things I've written for the Eagle's Nest BBS, and 
that have been passed along by other sysops. See the ChangeLog
for more details.

The only semi-serious bug I've found in EBBS 3.1 is a buffer in 
the chat daemon that could get overflowed by a long hostname. Now, 
I doubt anyone can encode the typical buffer overflow nastiness into 
a hostname and not have name servers choke on it, but who knows.

UPGRADING FROM EBBS-3.1 TO EBBS-3.1.1:

The new MoveMessage feature for moving posts from one board to 
another requires that a couple of lines be added to your existing
~bbs/etc/access and ~bbs/etc/menu.desc files.

To you access file, add these lines right after the FileChdir entry:

# C_MOVEMESSAGE 98   Move a post from one board to another
MoveMessage=ALL

You may leave the access set to ALL to allow any user to move their
own posts. Board managers can move them off of their boards also.

To your menu.desc file, add this to the readmenu "Main":

('t',  $PostMove,          $$P,  MoveMessage,
"t               Toss (move) post to another board")

I chose 't' for Toss since it seemed like the best available fit.
As always, you may assign your own keys and help text.

The ReleaseNotes for version 3.1 follow. If you are upgrading 
from something EARLIER then 3.1, please follow the instructions
below FIRST, then complete the above for the 3.1-3.1.1 move.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the official release of Eagles BBS 3.1. It's been over
two years since the EBBS 3.0.1 release. There have been quite
a few changes over those years, and it's never been really unstable,
but I've been too busy with other things to put together a release.

I wanted to set up this package to use GNU autoconf. It didn't
get done. You still have to edit the Makefile and osdeps.h.

Two new features were added in 3.1-BETA2. First are the /ignore
and /unignore commands in chat. Also, 8-bit character set support 
and ability to change and save character set mappings on the fly. 

Two new features were added in 3.1-BETA3. The file areas now allow
navigation of directories below the one listed in the ftplist.
Also, the PBBS library was patched to allow ANSI color to be used
the the code and in strings read from the config files. Be sure
to add -DCOLOR to the Makefile CCFLAGS is you want this. The color
support is very crude, but it's a starting point for hackers to
do something better with if desired.

The only changes since 3.1-BETA3 are bug fixes.

--- If you are upgrading from EBBS 3.1-BETA3 ---

No config file changes are necessary; just build and install the
binaries.

--- If you are upgrading from EBBS 3.1-BETA2 ---

No config file changes are necessary; just build and install the
binaries. If you are using the file boards, you may want to clean
up ~bbs/etc/ftplist a bit, as only the root directory of a directory
tree you want to be available need be listed now, as opposed to 
every directory having to be there as in the past.

--- If you are upgrading from EBBS 3.1-BETA ---

Five bbs config files were changed between 3.1-BETA and 3.1-BETA-2.
You should copy chathlp.txt and protos to your ~bbs/etc directory.
The access, bbconfig, and menu.desc also have additions. Add these
entries:

To your access file, after C_XYZMENU (entry 95):
# C_SETCHARSET  96   Set charset (if 8-bit support not needed, use NONE)
SetCharset=ALL

To your bbconfig file:
locale=

To your menu.desc file, in the (X)yz Menu description:
("Language", "Language", "Language", SetCharset,  $SetCharset,
"(L)anguage      Set language-dependent character mapping")

Finally, copy the charset files from the config directory to ~bbs/etc
if you wish to use the 8-bit support.

--- If you are upgrading from EBBS 3.0 or 3.01 ---

There are some cool new features in this version. Most noticable is the
new menus. That was the #1 gripe about EBBS up until now from what I can
tell, that there wasn't a friendly menu system like you see on dialup bbses.
Well it's there now, but still not in color. Maybe somebody will try to
rip out the old PBBS stuff and link with ncurses instead.

Note the new (M)enus function in the Xyz Menu. Be sure you get that entry
into your existing menu.desc is you are already running EBBS. That lets 
you revert to the old tried-and-true (and faster) menus.

Also we have two-way Internet mail capability now. I have written about it
in the EBBS-Guide, Chapter VII Section 2, "Internet Mail Support".
A couple of new files in this distribution are part of this new feature:
~bbs/bin/bbsmaild and ~bbs/etc/mailers. Be sure you copy those to your
bbs directories.

Also, the readmenus are now configurable (somewhat) and are defined in
~bbs/etc/menu.desc. If you already have a bbs, be SURE to cut the bottom
part with the readmenus out of the menu.desc in this distribution and
paste them into yours. Also don't to add forget (X)yz/(M)enus and
(X)yz/(L)anguage, as these are new in EBBS 3.1.

The chat daemon will display a message-of-the-day upon entry now, if
you put said message in ~bbs/etc/chat.motd.

In ~bbs/etc/bbconfig, the "mailer" entry is no longer used since there 
is a mailers files now. You can remove it. "reservedslots" is a new
option which allows you to reserve any number of slots for sysops,
allowing you access when others can't get in. "locale" is a new
option for setting the default locale for character typing and
collating, as in setlocale(3).

Finally, there are a few things new in the ~bbs/etc/access file. 
You MUST put these new entries in the right place or things are not
going to work properly! In fact you may consider just using the new
access file and setting up the permissions the same way you had them
before, to be safe. Here are the new entries:

# C_SETCLIOPTS  82   Set client options (i.e. expert/novice menus)
SetCliOpts=ALL

(C_SEEALLINFO through C_NOTIMEOUT are now 83-88. They must be AFTER
 C_SETCLIOPTS in the access file.)

# C_USERESERVED 89   Can use specially reserved user table slots.
UseReserved=Sysop
# C_EXTERNMAIL  90   May send/receive external e-mail.
ExternalMail=Sysop
# C_ADMINMENU   91   Admin Menu access
AdminMenu=Sysop,AccountMgr,BoardMgr
# C_FILEMENU    92   File Menu access
FileMenu=ALL
# C_MAILMENU    93   Mail Menu access
MailMenu=ALL
# C_TALKMENU    94   Talk Menu access
TalkMenu=ALL
# C_XYZMENU     95   Xyz Menu access
XyzMenu=ALL
# C_SETCHARSET  96   Set charset (if 8-bit support not needed, use NONE)
SetCharset=ALL

SUMMARY of things to do to upgrade from 3.0 or 3.01 to 3.1:

-- Update ~bbs/etc/access, ~bbs/etc/menu.desc, ~bbs/etc/bbconfig,
   ~bbs/etc/chathlp.txt, ~bbs/etc/protos as directed above or replace them

-- Copy new config files (mailers, modes if you don't have 3.01) to
   ~bbs/etc

-- Copy all executables (lbbs, chatd, addacct, delacct, bbslog, bbfinger,
   bbsmaild) to ~bbs/bin, and make bbsmail a link to bbsmaild if you like

-- If 2-way mail is desired, fix your sendmail.cf file to route bbs mail
   to bbsmaild (helpful hints in EBBS-Guide)

-- If you're using boardclean, get the new cleanpkg.tar.gz from datasync
   and put the new executable into ~bbs/bin

Lotd of changes and stuff. If you find any bugs, tell me about them.
Especially if you have trouble compiling. I only have Linux and limited, 
sporadic access to other operating systems so I count on you folks
to let me know when things break on non-Linux systems.

See the blurb in the README about the EBBS Mailing List if you haven't
already seen it.
